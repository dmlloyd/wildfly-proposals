== Overview

=== Background

==== Complex Injectors and Values Framework

Packages ``org.jboss.msc.inject`` and ``org.jboss.msc.value`` are
over-designed.  Their usage has lead to complex code, and non-trivial impact on memory.

==== Services Provide Single Value

This is limiting and has caused difficulties in some scenarios.

==== Insufficient Encapsulation

The previous API exposed state machine and implementation details.  Service objects
are accessible from any other service.

=== Proposed API Change

==== New Services API

==== Examples
